## About the Project:
This React web application was created to keep track of my Animal Crossing stats. There are multiple different pages to this project: Villagers, Player Stats, Flower Tracker, Bug Tracker, Fish Tracker, Photo Gallery, and Chat feature.

## Villagers:

This is what it looks like on desktop applications

This is what it looks like on smaller screens

The villagers section includes the villager's portrait, name, type, color, and a fun fact. On bigger windows, you are able to use navigation buttons to view them one by one. On smaller windows, it displays all the villagers at once. I utilized react state to check the window size to render the different displays.

## Player Stats

The Player stats includes basic information about my island and my playing style.

## Flower Tracker

The Flower Tracker shows the number of each type of flower that is on my island! To navigate to the next page, click the outlined flower next to the filled in one.


## Bug Tracker

The bug tracker displays each type of bug that I've caught while playing the game. To navigate to the next page, click the outlined bug next to the filled in one.

## Fish Tracker

The bug tracker displays each type of bug that I've caught while playing the game. Also includes what is said when the fish is caught or a fun fish pun! To navigate to the next page, click the outlined fish next to the filled in one.

## Photo Album

The photos are styled to look like little polaroids :)
To go to the next page of photos, click the outlined circle next to the filled in one.
There are two separate albums (island and friends). To switch between the albums, hit the suggested album button!

## Chat/Post Log

The "chat" mimics a chat by allowing the user to post comments! Click the add message button, then fill out the form (adding your name and message)

(the storage is only local and refreshes once the page is left- will possibly revisit this later to store to a file/database).

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
